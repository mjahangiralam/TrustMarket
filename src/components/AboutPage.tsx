          <p className="mb-4 text-lg text-slate-700">
            <b>AiEconLab</b> is dedicated to advancing the understanding of economics, trust, and cooperation through interactive technology and artificial intelligence. Our mission is to make complex social science concepts accessible and engaging for everyone.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4 text-lg text-slate-700">
            <b>Trust Market</b> is an interactive game and experiment designed to explore the dynamics of trust, cooperation, and strategy in social dilemmas. By simulating repeated interactions with AI agents, players can experience firsthand how trust is built, maintained, or broken, and how different strategies impact outcomes.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4 text-lg text-slate-700">
            <b>Our Vision:</b> We believe that learning is most effective when it is hands-on and immersive. Trust Market is not just a gameâ€”it's a research tool, a classroom resource, and a platform for discovery. We aim to bridge the gap between academic theory and real-world behavior.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-8 text-lg text-slate-700">
            <b>The Science:</b> Trust Market is based on principles from game theory, behavioral economics, and psychology. Each AI agent is programmed with a unique strategy, allowing players to explore classic dilemmas like the Prisoner's Dilemma in a modern, interactive way.
